Automation HAT is a home monitoring and automation controller featuring relays, analog channels, powered outputs, and buffered inputs (all 24V tolerant).  This library will also work with Automation HAT's smaller siblings - Automation pHAT and Automation HAT Mini.

### Where to buy

* Pimoroni Automation HAT: <https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/automation-hat>
* Pimoroni Automation HAT Mini: <https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/automation-hat-mini>

## Installing

### Full install (recommended):

We've created an easy installation script that will install all pre-requisites and get your BME680
up and running with minimal efforts. To run it, fire up Terminal which you'll find in Menu -> Accessories -> Terminal
on your Raspberry Pi desktop, as illustrated below:

![Finding the terminal](http://get.pimoroni.com/resources/github-repo-terminal.png)

In the new terminal window type the command exactly as it appears below (check for typos) and follow the on-screen instructions:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pimoroni/automationhat-python
cd automationhat-python
./install.sh
```

**Note** Libraries will be installed in the "pimoroni" virtual environment, you will need to activate it to run examples:

```
source ~/.virtualenvs/pimoroni/bin/activate
```

### Development:

If you want to contribute, or like living on the edge of your seat by having the latest code, you can install the development version like so:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pimoroni/automationhat-python
cd automationhat-python
./install.sh --unstable
```

In all cases you will have to enable the i2c bus:

```
sudo raspi-config nonint do_i2c 0
```

### FAQ

#### What is the accuracy and resolution of the Automation HAT

The ADS1015 is a 12-bit ADC, but since the 12th bit is the sign-bit there are only 11-bits of resolution available for positive voltage readings. The input voltage for 24v channels is scaled from 0-25.85v (25.85 rather than 24 due to how the resistor divider is set up) to 0-3.3v.

Since the full-scale range of the ADC is set to 4.096v, this means that 0-3.3v gives only ~1649 possible usable values making the input measurement granularity somewhere around 0.015v (25.85 / 1649) for the 24v inputs and 0.002v for the 3.3v input.
